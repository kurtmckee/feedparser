===============================================================================

1.0 - 9/27/2002 - MAP - fixed namespace processing on prefixed RSS 2.0 elements,
  added Simon Fell's test suite

1.1 - 9/29/2002 - MAP - fixed infinite loop on incomplete CDATA sections

2.0 - 10/19/2002
  JD - use inchannel to watch out for image and textinput elements which can
  also contain title, link, and description elements
  JD - check for isPermaLink='false' attribute on guid elements
  JD - replaced openAnything with open_resource supporting ETag and
  If-Modified-Since request headers
  JD - parse now accepts etag, modified, agent, and referrer optional
  arguments
  JD - modified parse to return a dictionary instead of a tuple so that any
  etag or modified information can be returned and cached by the caller

2.0.1 - 10/21/2002 - MAP - changed parse() so that if we don't get anything
  because of etag/modified, return the old etag/modified to the caller to
  indicate why nothing is being returned

2.0.2 - 10/21/2002 - JB - added the inchannel to the if statement, otherwise its
  useless.  Fixes the problem JD was addressing by adding it.

2.1 - 11/14/2002 - MAP - added gzip support

2.2 - 1/27/2003 - MAP - added attribute support, admin:generatorAgent.
  start_admingeneratoragent is an example of how to handle elements with
  only attributes, no content.

2.3 - 6/11/2003 - MAP - added USER_AGENT for default (if caller doesn't specify);
  also, make sure we send the User-Agent even if urllib2 isn't available.
  Match any variation of backend.userland.com/rss namespace.

2.3.1 - 6/12/2003 - MAP - if item has both link and guid, return both as-is.

2.4 - 7/9/2003 - MAP - added preliminary Pie/Atom/Echo support based on Sam Ruby's
  snapshot of July 1 <http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1506.html>; changed
  project name

2.5 - 7/25/2003 - MAP - changed to Python license (all contributors agree);
  removed unnecessary urllib code -- urllib2 should always be available anyway;
  return actual url, status, and full HTTP headers (as result['url'],
  result['status'], and result['headers']) if parsing a remote feed over HTTP --
  this should pass all the HTTP tests at <http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/http/>;
  added the latest namespace-of-the-week for RSS 2.0

2.5.1 - 7/26/2003 - RMK - clear opener.addheaders so we only send our custom
  User-Agent (otherwise urllib2 sends two, which confuses some servers)

2.5.2 - 7/28/2003 - MAP - entity-decode inline xml properly; added support for
  inline <xhtml:body> and <xhtml:div> as used in some RSS 2.0 feeds

2.5.3 - 8/6/2003 - TvdV - patch to track whether we're inside an image or
  textInput, and also to return the character encoding (if specified)

2.6 - 1/1/2004 - MAP - dc:author support (MarekK); fixed bug tracking
  nested divs within content (JohnD); fixed missing sys import (JohanS);
  fixed regular expression to capture XML character encoding (Andrei);
  added support for Atom 0.3-style links; fixed bug with textInput tracking;
  added support for cloud (MartijnP); added support for multiple
  category/dc:subject (MartijnP); normalize content model: 'description' gets
  description (which can come from description, summary, or full content if no
  description), 'content' gets dict of base/language/type/value (which can come
  from content:encoded, xhtml:body, content, or fullitem);
  fixed bug matching arbitrary Userland namespaces; added xml:base and xml:lang
  tracking; fixed bug tracking unknown tags; fixed bug tracking content when
  <content> element is not in default namespace (like Pocketsoap feed);
  resolve relative URLs in link, guid, docs, url, comments, wfw:comment,
  wfw:commentRSS; resolve relative URLs within embedded HTML markup in
  description, xhtml:body, content, content:encoded, title, subtitle,
  summary, info, tagline, and copyright; added support for pingback and
  trackback namespaces

2.7 - 1/5/2004 - MAP - really added support for trackback and pingback
  namespaces, as opposed to 2.6 when I said I did but didn't really;
  sanitize HTML markup within some elements; added mxTidy support (if
  installed) to tidy HTML markup within some elements; fixed indentation
  bug in _parse_date (FazalM); use socket.setdefaulttimeout if available
  (FazalM); universal date parsing and normalization (FazalM): 'created', modified',
  'issued' are parsed into 9-tuple date format and stored in 'created_parsed',
  'modified_parsed', and 'issued_parsed'; 'date' is duplicated in 'modified'
  and vice-versa; 'date_parsed' is duplicated in 'modified_parsed' and vice-versa

2.7.1 - 1/9/2004 - MAP - fixed bug handling &quot; and &apos;.  fixed memory
  leak not closing url opener (JohnD); added dc:publisher support (MarekK);
  added admin:errorReportsTo support (MarekK); Python 2.1 dict support (MarekK)

2.7.4 - 1/14/2004 - MAP - added workaround for improperly formed <br/> tags in
  encoded HTML (skadz); fixed unicode handling in normalize_attrs (ChrisL);
  fixed relative URI processing for guid (skadz); added ICBM support; added
  base64 support

2.7.5 - 1/15/2004 - MAP - added workaround for malformed DOCTYPE (seen on many
  blogspot.com sites); added _debug variable

2.7.6 - 1/16/2004 - MAP - fixed bug with StringIO importing

3.0b3 - 1/23/2004 - MAP - parse entire feed with real XML parser (if available);
  added several new supported namespaces; fixed bug tracking naked markup in
  description; added support for enclosure; added support for source; re-added
  support for cloud which got dropped somehow; added support for expirationDate

3.0b4 - 1/26/2004 - MAP - fixed xml:lang inheritance; fixed multiple bugs tracking
  xml:base URI, one for documents that don't define one explicitly and one for
  documents that define an outer and an inner xml:base that goes out of scope
  before the end of the document

3.0b5 - 1/26/2004 - MAP - fixed bug parsing multiple links at feed level

3.0b6 - 1/27/2004 - MAP - added feed type and version detection, result['version']
  will be one of SUPPORTED_VERSIONS.keys() or empty string if unrecognized;
  added support for creativeCommons:license and cc:license; added support for
  full Atom content model in title, tagline, info, copyright, summary; fixed bug
  with gzip encoding (not always telling server we support it when we do)

3.0b7 - 1/28/2004 - MAP - support Atom-style author element in author_detail
  (dictionary of 'name', 'url', 'email'); map author to author_detail if author
  contains name + email address

3.0b8 - 1/28/2004 - MAP - added support for contributor

3.0b9 - 1/29/2004 - MAP - fixed check for presence of dict function; added
  support for summary

3.0b10 - 1/31/2004 - MAP - incorporated ISO-8601 date parsing routines from
  xml.util.iso8601

3.0b11 - 2/2/2004 - MAP - added 'rights' to list of elements that can contain
  dangerous markup; fiddled with decodeEntities (not right); liberalized
  date parsing even further

3.0b12 - 2/6/2004 - MAP - fiddled with decodeEntities (still not right);
  added support to Atom 0.2 subtitle; added support for Atom content model
  in copyright; better sanitizing of dangerous HTML elements with end tags
  (script, frameset)

3.0b13 - 2/8/2004 - MAP - better handling of empty HTML tags (br, hr, img,
  etc.) in embedded markup, in either HTML or XHTML form (<br>, <br/>, <br />)

3.0b14 - 2/8/2004 - MAP - fixed CDATA handling in non-wellformed feeds under
  Python 2.1

3.0b15 - 2/11/2004 - MAP - fixed bug resolving relative links in wfw:commentRSS;
  fixed bug capturing author and contributor URL; fixed bug resolving relative
  links in author and contributor URL; fixed bug resolving relative links in
  generator URL; added support for recognizing RSS 1.0; passed Simon Fell's
  namespace tests, and included them permanently in the test suite with his
  permission; fixed namespace handling under Python 2.1

  name was in parentheses; removed ultra-problematic mxTidy support; patch to
  workaround crash in PyXML/expat when encountering invalid entities
  (MarkMoraes); support for textinput/textInput

3.0b20 - 4/7/2004 - MAP - added CDF support

3.0b21 - 4/14/2004 - MAP - added Hot RSS support

3.0b22 - 4/19/2004 - MAP - changed 'channel' to 'feed', 'item' to 'entries' in
  results dict; changed results dict to allow getting values with results.key
  as well as results[key]; work around embedded illformed HTML with half
  a DOCTYPE; work around malformed Content-Type header; if character encoding
  is wrong, try several common ones before falling back to regexes (if this
  works, bozo_exception is set to CharacterEncodingOverride); fixed character
  encoding issues in BaseHTMLProcessor by tracking encoding and converting
  from Unicode to raw strings before feeding data to sgmllib.SGMLParser;
  convert each value in results to Unicode (if possible), even if using
  regex-based parsing

3.0b23 - 4/21/2004 - MAP - fixed UnicodeDecodeError for feeds that contain
  high-bit characters in attributes in embedded HTML in description (thanks
  Thijs van de Vossen); moved guid, date, and date_parsed to mapped keys in
  FeedParserDict; tweaked FeedParserDict.has_key to return True if asking
  about a mapped key

3.0fc1 - 4/23/2004 - MAP - made results.entries[0].links[0] and
  results.entries[0].enclosures[0] into FeedParserDict; fixed typo that could
  cause the same encoding to be tried twice (even if it failed the first time);
  fixed DOCTYPE stripping when DOCTYPE contained entity declarations;
  better textinput and image tracking in illformed RSS 1.0 feeds

3.0fc2 - 5/10/2004 - MAP - added and passed Sam's amp tests; added and passed
  my blink tag tests

3.0fc3 - 6/18/2004 - MAP - fixed bug in _changeEncodingDeclaration that
  failed to parse utf-16 encoded feeds; made source into a FeedParserDict;
  duplicate admin:generatorAgent/@rdf:resource in generator_detail.url;
  added support for image; refactored parse() fallback logic to try other
  encodings if SAX parsing fails (previously it would only try other encodings
  if re-encoding failed); remove unichr madness in normalize_attrs now that
  we're properly tracking encoding in and out of BaseHTMLProcessor; set
  feed.language from root-level xml:lang; set entry.id from rdf:about;
  send Accept header

3.0 - 6/21/2004 - MAP - don't try iso-8859-1 (can't distinguish between
  iso-8859-1 and windows-1252 anyway, and most incorrectly marked feeds are
  windows-1252); fixed regression that could cause the same encoding to be
  tried twice (even if it failed the first time)

3.0.1 - 6/22/2004 - MAP - default to us-ascii for all text/* content types;
  recover from malformed content-type header parameter with no equals sign
  ('text/xml; charset:iso-8859-1')

  to Unicode equivalents in illformed feeds (aaronsw); added and
  passed tests for converting character entities to Unicode equivalents
  in illformed feeds (aaronsw); test for valid parsers when setting
  XML_AVAILABLE; make version and encoding available when server returns
  a 304; add handlers parameter to pass arbitrary urllib2 handlers (like
  digest auth or proxy support); add code to parse username/password
  out of url and send as basic authentication; expose downloading-related
  exceptions in bozo_exception (aaronsw); added __contains__ method to
  FeedParserDict (aaronsw); added publisher_detail (aaronsw)

3.2 - 7/3/2004 - MAP - use cjkcodecs and iconv_codec if available; always
  convert feed to UTF-8 before passing to XML parser; completely revamped
  logic for determining character encoding and attempting XML parsing
  (much faster); increased default timeout to 20 seconds; test for presence
  of Location header on redirects; added tests for many alternate character
  encodings; support various EBCDIC encodings; support UTF-16BE and
  UTF16-LE with or without a BOM; support UTF-8 with a BOM; support
  UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE with or without a BOM; fixed crashing bug if no
  XML parsers are available; added support for 'Content-encoding: deflate';
  send blank 'Accept-encoding: ' header if neither gzip nor zlib modules
  are available

3.3 - 7/15/2004 - MAP - optimize EBCDIC to ASCII conversion; fix obscure
  problem tracking xml:base and xml:lang if element declares it, child
  doesn't, first grandchild redeclares it, and second grandchild doesn't;
  refactored date parsing; defined public registerDateHandler so callers
  can add support for additional date formats at runtime; added support
  for OnBlog, Nate, MSSQL, Greek, and Hungarian dates (ytrewq1); added
  zopeCompatibilityHack() which turns FeedParserDict into a regular
  dictionary, required for Zope compatibility, and also makes command-
  line debugging easier because pprint module formats real dictionaries
  better than dictionary-like objects; added NonXMLContentType exception,
  which is stored in bozo_exception when a feed is served with a non-XML
  media type such as 'text/plain'; respect Content-Language as default
  language if not xml:lang is present; cloud dict is now FeedParserDict;
  generator dict is now FeedParserDict; better tracking of xml:lang,
  including support for xml:lang='' to unset the current language;
  recognize RSS 1.0 feeds even when RSS 1.0 namespace is not the default
  namespace; don't overwrite final status on redirects (scenarios:
  redirecting to a URL that returns 304, redirecting to a URL that
  redirects to another URL with a different type of redirect); add
